            <h1>AKAN NAMES</h1>
            <p>
              Akan naming is a tradition that originates from the Akan people of
              Ghana. <br />
              It's a culture where children are named after the day of week they
              were born and their gender. <br />
              The convention is widely shared in parts of Africa, with several
              notable figures spotting the "day names". <br />
              Ghana's president
              <strong>Kwame</strong> Nkurumah and former United Nations
              Secretary-General <strong>Kofi</strong> Annan are <br />
              examples of public figures with Akan names. <br />
              <br />

              various 'day names' as used by the Akan people.
